# CT-Marks-Web-App-CT-Plus

A web-based system to manage, display, and analyze Class Test (CT) marks of students, with support for revaluation requests and role-based access for Students, Subject Teachers, Class Incharges, and the HOD.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

In most academic institutions, Class Test (CT) marks are managed manually or through scattered spreadsheets and notice boards. This leads to several issues:

- Students have no centralized, real-time way to view their marks.
- Students who wish to challenge their evaluated marks have no formal, trackable process for requesting revaluation.
- Subject Teachers have no structured system to update marks or manage revaluation requests efficiently.
- Class Incharges cannot easily monitor the performance of their entire class across multiple subjects.
- The HOD lacks a consolidated view of marks and activity logs across multiple classes and subjects, making performance analysis and audit difficult.

There is a need for a single, role-based web application that streamlines mark entry, viewing, revaluation, and performance analysis for all stakeholders.

---

## 2. Objective

- To design and develop a web application that digitizes the CT marks management process.
- To allow students to view their marks and raise revaluation requests online.
- To enable subject teachers to enter/edit marks and respond to revaluation notifications.
- To allow class incharges to monitor all students' marks across all subjects for their class.
- To provide the HOD with a consolidated dashboard to view marks, analyze performance across multiple classes, and track all mark-related activities.
- To automatically classify students into performance categories based on their marks.

## 6. Performance Categorization

Based on marks obtained, students are automatically categorized:

| Percentage Range | Category |
|---|---|
| 85% and above | Excellent |
| 70% – 84% | Good |
| 50% – 69% | Average |
| Below 50% | Needs Improvement |

This ensures every student is evaluated on a common, fair scale regardless of the total marks of each individual CT.

##  Conclusion

The CT Marks Web Application provides a centralized, role-based platform that simplifies mark management 
and revaluation across all levels of an academic department — from students to the HOD. It reduces manual 
effort, improves transparency, ensures accountability through activity tracking, and enables data-driven 
performance analysis. This project can serve as a scalable foundation for a full-fledged academic 
management system.
